# 🧠 Big Data & Data Mining Course Projects

This repository contains a collection of assignments and mini-projects completed during my undergraduate course in **Big Data and Data Mining**. The tasks are designed to explore various concepts ranging from data preprocessing to machine learning model evaluation using **PySpark**, **MLlib**, and other essential tools.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

### 📦 Data Preparation
- Creating data lists (structured/unstructured)
- Text preprocessing & data cleaning
- Tokenization & stopword removal
- Converting to Spark RDD & DataFrame
- Data manipulation and transformation
- Data integration and joins

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding data distribution
- Handling missing values & outliers
- Feature selection and transformation

### 🤖 Machine Learning with MLlib
- Classification:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Naive Bayes  
- Regression:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Model tuning & evaluation
- Clustering:  
  - DBSCAN  
  - K-Means (if used)

### ⚙️ Model Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Train-test split & cross-validation
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, RMSE, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Apache Spark (PySpark)  
- Spark MLlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas & Numpy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📁 Structure
Each folder represents a different module or task and contains:
- Notebook/script file (`.ipynb` / `.py`)
- Output or result visualizations

## 📌 Notes
All code was developed as part of academic learning and is intended for educational purposes only.
