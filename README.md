📊 Big Data & Data Mining Projects

This repository contains a collection of assignments and exercises from my university coursework on **Big Data and Data Mining**, 
focused on both theoretical and practical aspects using **PySpark** and **MLlib**.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Spark MLlib
- RDD & DataFrame APIs
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 1. 🔥 Introduction to PySpark
- Spark architecture and components
- Working with SparkContext and SparkSession

### 2. 🧱 RDD & DataFrame
- Creating and manipulating RDDs
- Transformations and actions on RDD
- DataFrame creation, schema inference, and queries

### 3. 🛠️ Data Manipulation & Joins
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data
- Joining datasets using DataFrame API

### 4. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Visualization of patterns and distributions

### 5. 🧪 Machine Learning with MLlib
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train-test split, model selection

#### 💡 Algorithms Implemented:
- **Regression** (Linear Regression)
- **Classification**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Naive Bayes
- **Clustering**:
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN

### 6. ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning & Evaluation
- Using ParamGridBuilder and CrossValidator
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, RMSE, confusion matrix, etc.)

## 🎓 Notes
This project was developed as part of coursework in the **Big Data and Data Mining** subject during my undergraduate study. 
The focus was on hands-on implementation using scalable tools and interpreting the results in real-world scenarios.
